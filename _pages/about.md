I am a Senior Research Associate at JP Morgan Chaseworking on deep learning and quantum computing. 

Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in Physics at University of Chicago (2020–2025), with a dissertation titled [Deep Learning and Non-Invertible Symmetries in Gauge Theories](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/15055?v=pdf)
My Ph.D. advisor was [Clay Córdova](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/clay-cordova/). 

I earned a B.S. in Physics and Philosophy from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2016-2020). 
During my time at MIT, I worked with [Scott A. Hughes](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/scott-hughes/) on  black-hole physics and [Mingda Li](https://nse.mit.edu/people/mingda-li/) on topological materials. 

Research interests include:
- **Quantum computation**: heuristic algorithms, hardware demonstrations, simulation of physical systems on quantum computers
- **Deep learning**: optimization methods, learning quantum states
- **Quantum field theory**: topological phases of matter

If you would like to like to collaborate or discuss any of these topics feel free to reach out via email !
